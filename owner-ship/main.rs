//Stack: LIFO (Last In, First Out) stores data in the order it receives it
//.Data in the stack is stored in a contiguous block of memory with fixed size.
//.The stack is used for static memory allocation.
//.The stack is faster than the heap because it has direct access to the data.
//.The stack is used for function calls and local variables.
//.The stack is limited in size.
//.The stack is thread-safe.
//.The stack is not flexible.
//.The stack is not resizable.

//Heap: Stores data in any order and allows access to any data at any time.
//.Data in the heap is stored in a non-contiguous block of memory with dynamic size.
//.The heap is slower than the stack because it has to look up the data in the memory.
//.The heap is used for dynamic memory allocation.
//.The heap is not limited in size.
//.The heap is not thread-safe.
//.The heap is flexible.
//.The heap is resizable.

//RULES
//1. Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
//2. There can only be one owner at a time.
//3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
//4. The value will be dropped when the owner goes out of scope.
//Ownership Rules
//apply for strings, vectors, files, and other data types.
