The TypeState Pattern combined with the Builder Pattern in Rust is a powerful design technique to enforce compile-time correctness of state transitions. This pattern ensures that certain operations are only performed when the system is in a specific state, leveraging Rust's strong type system to provide these guarantees.

Here's a detailed example to illustrate how to implement a TypeState Builder Pattern in Rust.

### Example: Building a Car

Let's say we want to build a car, and it must go through specific states during its construction: `EngineInstalled`, `Painted`, and `Ready`.

#### Step 1: Define the States

First, define the different states as marker structs:

```rust
struct EngineInstalled;
struct Painted;
struct Ready;
```

#### Step 2: Define the CarBuilder Struct

Define the `CarBuilder` struct with a generic parameter to represent the current state:

```rust
struct CarBuilder<State> {
    state: State,
    engine: Option<String>,
    color: Option<String>,
}

impl CarBuilder<()> {
    pub fn new() -> CarBuilder<()> {
        CarBuilder {
            state: (),
            engine: None,
            color: None,
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 3: Implement State Transitions

Implement methods to transition between states. Each method consumes the current builder and returns a new builder in the next state.

```rust
impl CarBuilder<()> {
    pub fn install_engine(self, engine: String) -> CarBuilder<EngineInstalled> {
        CarBuilder {
            state: EngineInstalled,
            engine: Some(engine),
            color: self.color,
        }
    }
}

impl CarBuilder<EngineInstalled> {
    pub fn paint(self, color: String) -> CarBuilder<Painted> {
        CarBuilder {
            state: Painted,
            engine: self.engine,
            color: Some(color),
        }
    }
}

impl CarBuilder<Painted> {
    pub fn finalize(self) -> CarBuilder<Ready> {
        CarBuilder {
            state: Ready,
            engine: self.engine,
            color: self.color,
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 4: Build the Final Product

Add a method to build the final product only when the builder is in the `Ready` state.

```rust
struct Car {
    engine: String,
    color: String,
}

impl CarBuilder<Ready> {
    pub fn build(self) -> Car {
        Car {
            engine: self.engine.unwrap(),
            color: self.color.unwrap(),
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Usage Example

Here's how to use the `CarBuilder`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let car = CarBuilder::new()
        .install_engine("V8".to_string())
        .paint("Red".to_string())
        .finalize()
        .build();

    println!("Car with {} engine and {} color", car.engine, car.color);
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Marker Structs**: The marker structs (`EngineInstalled`, `Painted`, `Ready`) represent the states of the builder.
2. **State Transition Methods**: Each state transition method (`install_engine`, `paint`, `finalize`) consumes the builder and returns a new builder in the next state.
3. **Build Method**: The `build` method is only available in the `Ready` state, ensuring that the car can only be built after all necessary steps have been completed.

By using the TypeState Pattern with the Builder Pattern, we ensure that the car can only be constructed correctly, and attempts to build the car without completing all required steps result in a compile-time error. This approach leverages Rust's type system to enforce state transitions and ensures the correctness of the construction process.
